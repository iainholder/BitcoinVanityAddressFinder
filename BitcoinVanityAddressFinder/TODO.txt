NOT DOING
===============================================================================
Logging? Previous results window? - not doing. too many dangerous implications.
Design time viewmodel - not doing - just used fallback values
Switch PC off when done? - not doing as not going to log.
If search text is all numbers, make search case sensitive to avoid touppering? - probably not worth doing. the ux could get confusing if we keep on automatically toggling based on value in textbox.
